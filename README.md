# Rock & Roll with Ember.js

Personal implementation of the course material in Rock & Roll with Ember

(Original README in [README.RARWE.md](README.RARWE.md)!)


## Notes

- (On Windows) You might have to run this from an elevated command line woopsie
- Commits will use internal page numbers (as you would have when printing), not the page number that the PDF file displays.
- You can use [run.sh](run.sh) to run common commands. The `ember` commands were supplied by the course, the `docker` and localhost proxy commands are for use with the homebrew [fallback back-end server](https://github.com/Denperidge/rarwe-backend).
